            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1. Ensure GST Configuration:</b><br>
                Before generating invoices, go to <b>reports</b> &rarr; <b>gst</b> and verify that your GSTIN is correctly entered. This is crucial for compliance and ensures that your invoices are valid for tax purposes. Double-check that your company details, such as address and contact information, are up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>2. Create and Customize Invoices:</b><br>
                When creating a new invoice, fill in all product or service details, including HSN/SAC codes and applicable GST rates. Caddayn Biller provides fields for itemized tax columns, so you can clearly display CGST, SGST, IGST, and other relevant taxes. Review the invoice preview to ensure all information is correct and that the format meets your business and compliance needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>3. Generate Monthly Invoice Reports:</b><br>
                Navigate to the <b>Reports</b> section from the main menu. Select the <b>General</b> column or choose <b>Invoice Report</b>. Set the date range to cover the month for which you need to submit tax invoices. The report will display a summary of all invoices issued in that period, including GST details and totals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>4. Download or Export Invoices:</b><br>
                From the report view, use the <b>Download</b> or <b>Export</b> button to save invoices as PDF files. You can download individual invoices for specific transactions or export a batch report containing all invoices for the selected month. This makes it easy to submit your records to tax authorities or share them with your accountant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>5. Check Compliance:</b><br>
                Always ensure that your invoices meet government compliance standards. Each invoice should include the invoice number, date, buyer and seller details, GSTIN, HSN/SAC codes, itemized taxes, and the total amount. Caddayn Biller’s templates are designed to include all these fields, but it is your responsibility to verify that the information is accurate before submission.

            <h2>Important Reminders</h2>

                <li>
                    <b>GSTIN Configuration:</b> Your GSTIN must be correctly configured in the company profile. Incorrect GSTIN can lead to compliance issues and rejected filings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Invoice Format:</b> The invoice format should meet all government requirements. This includes having a unique invoice number, correct dates, buyer and seller information, itemized tax columns, and the total invoice amount.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Record Keeping:</b> Always keep digital copies of your invoices and reports for your records. This will help you in case of audits or future reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Preview Before Download:</b> Use the preview option to verify the invoice format and details before downloading or exporting.
                </li>
